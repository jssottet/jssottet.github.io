Researcher in Model-Driven Engineering with a peculiar concerns about human aspects of modelling...
I worked for some year on the generation of user interface from functional/workflow models. This area still not fully covered
and needs a deeper research, notably how to manage the transition from a very abstract models to a detailled one.
Then I focused on model-driven engineering and more pecularly on natural modelling, starting from software design to more
organisational (e.g., enterprise architecture) aspects.

### More Information

My research interest is in natural modelling, inference and all the stuff that could make models more pervasive in our design activities.
This is something that could be applied to any
